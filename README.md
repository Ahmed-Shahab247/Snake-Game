Snake Game

Overview

This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle module. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food to grow, and avoid collisions with walls or itself. The score is tracked and resets upon collision.

Features

Snake moves automatically and can be controlled using arrow keys.

Eating food increases the snake's size and updates the score.

The game resets if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Uses turtle graphics for rendering.

Notes

Ensure all game files (snake.py, food.py, scoreboard.py) are present in the same directory as snake_game.py.

The game runs in a graphical window, so ensure your system supports turtle graphics.
